## Abstract

Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image
segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not
only do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is
while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications for
the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture based
on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We compared different backbones architectures like U-Net, V-Net and FCN as sampling
data from the conditional distribution for the encoder. We evaluate our work on
the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and
Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model outperforms
previous state of the art results while making use of uncertainty quantification in a
bayesian manner.
